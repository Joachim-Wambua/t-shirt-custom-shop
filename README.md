# 3D T-Shirt Customization App

Welcome to the 3D T-Shirt Customization App, a cutting-edge project that empowers users to personalize their T-shirts in 3D! Built with ReactJS, React-Three-Fibre, and integrated with OpenAI's DALL-E 3 API, this application takes T-shirt customization to the next level.

## Features

- **Color Customization:** Choose from a spectrum of colors to make your T-shirt uniquely yours.

- **Logo Upload:** Upload your own logo design to be seamlessly applied to the front of the 3D T-shirt.

- **Texture Upload:** Add a personal touch by uploading a texture to be applied to the T-shirt.

- **AI-Powered Design Generation:** Leverage OpenAI's DALL-E 3 API to use chat prompts for generating logo designs or textures.

## OpenAI Integration
To integrate with OpenAI's DALL-E 3 API, obtain your API key and add it to the appropriate configuration file (e.g., .env).
